      <h2 class="policy-title">Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p class="policy-intro">At HomeVue, we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect the information gathered from users of our interior design app. By using HomeVue, you acknowledge and agree to the practices outlined in this policy.</p>
     <div id="data-collection" class="privacy-block fade-in">
      <h3>1. Data Collection</h3>
      <p>HomeVue collects only the necessary information to provide a smooth and personalized experience:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your name, email address, and date of birth. This information helps us personalize your experience and understand the age demographics of our users. Your password is securely stored in encrypted form.</li>
        <li><strong>Room Data:</strong> When you scan and choose to save a room, the spatial mapping data (such as dimensions and layout) is stored locally on your device. This data is used solely to enable accurate room visualization and furniture placement. We do not collect or store this data on our servers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>HomeVue does <strong>not</strong> collect photographic images or videos of your space. <p>We provide an in-app screenshot feature that allows users to capture their AR layout for personal use. These images are stored locally in Photo Library and are not uploaded, collected, or accessed by us in any way.</p>
      The app uses your device’s camera strictly for spatial mapping, and no identifiable visual data is stored or transmitted. HomeVue is compatible only with iPhone and iPad models that support LiDAR scanning.</p>
      </div>


      <div id="data-usage" class="privacy-block fade-in">
        <h3>2. How We Use Your Data</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Providing Core Services:</strong> We use the collected data primarily to deliver the core functions of HomeVue, including room scanning, furniture placement, and design saving.</li>
          <li><strong>Account Management:</strong> For users with accounts, we use email addresses for authentication, password recovery, and sending important service updates.</li>
         <li><strong>Design Storage and Sharing:</strong> Only the room scan data — including spatial layout and dimensions — is saved locally within the app. Furniture placement, textures, and design elements are not stored unless you choose to export the design as a 3D model. Exported files are generated solely for sharing and are not uploaded or stored by us.</li>
         <li><strong>App Improvement:</strong> All improvements to HomeVue are based on direct user feedback and internal testing — no user behavior is tracked within the app.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div id="data-storage" class="privacy-block fade-in">
        <h3>3. Local vs. Cloud Storage</h3>
        <p>HomeVue implements a privacy-focused approach to data storage:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All room scan data, including 3D meshes and spatial information, is stored exclusively on your local device. Your room designs, including furniture placement information, are also stored locally.</li>
          <li><strong>Cloud Storage:</strong> Our furniture 3D models are stored in the cloud and downloaded to your device when needed.</li>
          <li><strong>User Account Data:</strong> If you create an account, your authentication information is stored securely in our cloud database. This allows you to access your account across different devices.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div id="camera-access" class="privacy-block fade-in">
        <h3>4. Camera and Photo Library Access</h3>
        <p>HomeVue requires access to your device's camera to enable AR functionality for scanning rooms and placing furniture. Additionally, the app requests photo library access to save images of your designs when you take a screenshot. These permissions are essential for core app functionality but can be managed in your device settings at any time.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Camera Processing:</strong> All camera processing for AR functionality happens locally on your device. Live camera feed is not recorded or transmitted to our servers.</li>
          <li><strong>Photo Saving:</strong> When you choose to save a design image to your photo library, this action occurs locally on your device after you provide explicit permission.</li>
          <li><strong>Permission Management:</strong> You can review and manage all app permissions through your device's Settings app at any time.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div id="data-security" class="privacy-block fade-in">
        <h3>5. Data Security</h3>
        <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Data Encryption:</strong> All data transferred between your device and our servers is encrypted using industry-standard TLS protocols. Stored data is protected using AES-256 encryption.</li>
          <li><strong>Secure Authentication:</strong> User authentication is handled through secure methods with password hashing and salting to ensure credentials remain protected.</li>
          <li><strong>Regular Security Audits:</strong> We conduct periodic security assessments of our systems and update our practices to address emerging threats.</li>
        </ul>
